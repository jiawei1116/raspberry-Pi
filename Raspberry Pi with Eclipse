Raspberry Pi with Eclipse

Eclipse in VM:
Build:
In eclipse build the project as normal (nor cross) programm.
Build the Project binary
Check for the binary to be of type "arm/le" as shown in the project explorer.
Remote connection to the board:
Setup a new connection:
File>new>Other Remote-System-Explorer>Connection
Set system type to Linux
Set hostname to IP, goto next
Change the Files Configuration choice to "ssh.files", goto next
Change the Processes Configuration to "processes.shell.linux", goto next
Change the Shells Configuration to "ssh.shells"
Finish
Use an existing one:
Window > Open Perspective > Other > Remote-System-Explorer
Mark the desired connection and right-click mouse button:
Select connect, userid=pi and password=raspberry
mark save password
use/cancel the popup window "Secure Storage"
you should be connected now (rightclick connection shows now a disconnect entry)
and look into your files in the home directory.
Debug:
Do not use the DEBUG-Button when using debug for  the FIRST time. Eclipse will build the wrong debug configuration!
Mark the top of the project in the project explorer and right-click mouse button, then
select "Debug As" and "Debug Configurations"
Mark "C/C++ Remote Application" and press New
Check, that the right project and application is filled in
Set "Enable auto build" and
configure the connection to the board  (the remote connection configured before)
setup the "Remote Absolute File Path..." to /tmp
Check that at the bottom "Using GDB (DSF) Automatic Remote Debugging Launcher" is listed.
